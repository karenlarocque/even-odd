	<!-- Include the [jQuery library](http://jquery.com/), which helps you manipulate HTML elements from JS. -->
	<script src="jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script>
	
	<!-- Include my library, [mmturkey][mmturkey], which manages submitting data to Mechanical Turk. This defines a global object, <code>turk</code>, and attaches five properties to it, <code>hitId</code>, <code>assignmentId</code>, <code>workerId</code>, <code>previewMode</code>, and <code>turkSubmitTo</code>. It also provides a single method, <code>submit(data)</code>, which you use to submit data to Turk. If no submission URL has been provided (because, e.g. you're testing your code outside of the Turk environment), <code>submit</code> displays what would have been submitted (without, obviously, any Turk-specific variables like <code>workerId</code> and <code>assignmentId</code>).  -->

	<!-- Include the cascading style sheet (CSS), which lets us separate style from content. This stylesheet is important because it defines the notion of a **slide** and also makes things look nicer, which subjects appreciate. It's worth looking at the [source code](style.html). -->

<!-- Include the <a href="experiment.html">JavaScript file for the experiment</a>. As written, that script immediately executes commands, so we include it here at the end of the HTML file to ensure that resources referenced by the script actually exist. For instance, one of the immediately executed commands is <code>showSlide("instructions")</code>. If we loaded experiment.js, say, in the <code>head</code> section, <code>showSlide("instructions")</code> would fail because the <code>instructions</code> slide doesn't exist yet. It is possible to load the script in <code>head</code> but you have to ensure that any immediately executed commands, if they rely on potentially uninitialized HTML elements, are _delayed_ until the page is ready, using either [window.onload][onload] or jQuery's more robust [$(document).ready()][domReady]  -->
